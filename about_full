            Hello! My name is Caleb and I am a mechanical engineer driven by logic, curiosity, and a passion for understanding how things work.
            My strengths lie in mathematics, critical thinking, and hands-on problem solving, and I’ve always been
            motivated by the challenge of building systems that are both functional and elegant. What sets me apart is
            my ability to think creatively under pressure, adapt quickly to unfamiliar circumstances, and draw on
            years of international experience to work in any environment.
        </p>

        <p>
            I chose a career in engineering because it combines everything I enjoy: designing, analyzing, calculating,
            experimenting, and transforming an idea into a working solution. When approaching a problem,
            I break it down into manageable parts, explore it from multiple angles, and use a mix of hands-on testing
            and theoretical reasoning to build a complete understanding. I value hard work, intellectual honesty,
            and seeing projects through from concept to completion. Collaboration is also important to me; I enjoy
            working with diverse teams and explaining technical ideas in clear, structured ways that make sense to
            everyone.
        </p>

        <p>
            My personal journey has shaped both my resilience and the way I approach engineering. I left Canada when
            I was eleven and spent some time traveling across several countries before completing high school in Dakar,
            Senegal. There I earned my International Baccalaureate diploma, choosing Higher Level math, physics, and
            chemistry, as well as a Delf B1 French Proficiency Diploma. I returned to Canada to study mechanical engineering
            at the University of Toronto, specializing in Mechatronics, Manufacturing, and Robotics.
        </p>

        <p>
            During my co-op year, I worked in industrial automation across the U.S. and Canada, an experience that let me
            explore new environments while developing my engineering skills. I was given leadership opportunities, supervisory positions over tradework,
            and established high-professional standards with my employers. These roles taught me accountability, adaptability,
            and strengthened my ability to communicate complex problems to people with different engineering backgrounds.
        </p>

        <p>
            Outside of work, I have designed a wide range of robots, analyzed mechanical and structural
            systems, and built tools that span from websites to simulations. One project that stands out is CakeBot,
            a fully autonomous robot I designed to navigate a maze, localize, and detect and relocate blocks. 
            The project taught me critical mechatronics fundamentals and pushed me to develop robust
            solutions under tight deadlines. It solidified my interest in automation and robotics and represents the
            kinds of technical challenges I thrive in.
        </p>

        <p>
            My professional strengths include SolidWorks for CAD, Python for programming, and Studio5000 for PLC development,
            along with a range of tools for design, analysis, and automation. I’m particularly drawn to work in robotics,
            automation, mechanical design, and software-adjacent engineering.

        <p>
            In my free time, I enjoy basketball, piano, chess, travel, and spending time with friends and family.
            One of the milestones I’m most proud of is getting married in August 2025, a moment that marked a new chapter in my life.
            I’ve also challenged myself physically by completing a Tough Mudder, pushing my limits and testing my perseverance.
        </p>

        <p>
            I’m excited dive deeper into real-world engineering challenges. I’m open to both remote and in-person opportunities and 
            am very willing to relocate for the right role. I want to develop new
            skills and solve meaningful problems, and I’m motivated to prove my value
            through hard work, creativity, and a commitment to continuous improvement.
